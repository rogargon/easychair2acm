Without having to pour through all author and submission data manually.

**IMPORTANT**: the `paper_type` is fixed to "Full Paper" for all submissions. This field has to be adjusted manually 
following the instructions at [https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/papertypes-csvfields-current.pdf]().

## Steps

1. In chair role, click the `Premium` tab and then `Conference data download`.
2. Click the link corresponding to `If you would like to view which tables are included in the CSV data, or download only a subset of these tables`.
3. Select the tables `submission` and `author` and download them.
4. Extract the accepted articles from the `submission.csv` file and copy them to a file named `accepted.csv` 
in the same directory as the `easychair2acm.py` script.
5. Copy the `author.csv` file to `authors.csv` in the same directory as before.
6. Run `python easychair2acm.py` to get the output in `output_acm.csv`.
